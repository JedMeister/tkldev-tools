Check for:
==========

executable files:
-----------------

- all files in conf.d/
- all files in overlay/usr/lib/inithooks/firstboot.d/
- all files in overlay/usr/lib/inithooks/bin/
- all files in overlay/usr/local/bin
- 

invalid overlay file locations:
-------------------------------

- (could suggest that these should go in /usr/local!?)
- /usr/bin (i.e. overlay/usr/bin)
- /usr/sbin (i.e. ...)
- /usr/lib/
  
  - default exception: /usr/lib/inithooks
  - default exception: /usr/lib/confconsole

check for specific files:
-------------------------

- overlay/usr/lib/inithooks/firstboot.d/20regen-*

  - warn/fail if doesn't exist (may be overridden)

- conf.d/* - at least one file


Options to:
===========

- "strict" checking - i.e. non-zero exit even if only warnings
- exclusions file - a file that can keep track of exclusions to specific rules
- run on common with slightly different conf
