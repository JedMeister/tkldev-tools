Syntax: $(basename $0) appliance-name

When run anywhere on tkldev, this script will clone an appliance repo to a
local directory in /turnkey/fab/products/appliance-name. 

It also adjusts the git remotes so that TurnKey repo becomes 'turnkey' and 
'origin' becomes your GitHub fork of the repo. Please note though; it won't 
create it on Github if it doesn't exist. You'll still need to fork the relevant
appliance on GitHub if you wish to push your changes). 

If the directory already exists, then it will do the remotes adjustment as 
above. It will then checkout 'master', pull from TurnKey, and push back to
your forked repo on GitHub (assuming that it exists).

Once all that is done, it drops you in a new shell inside the directory.

Note: as it opens a new shell, extended usage (without killing all the 
additional subshells) may cause performance issues over time. If you work 
within an SSH session, you may need to exit multiple times to escape...

Prerequisites:

    GitHub account      - optional, but useful if you want to hack on it!
    SSH GH push access  - optional, but currently only supported push method

Arguments::

    appliance-name      - e.g., core

Environment::

    ORIGIN              - GitHub username to use for the origin repo
    DEVDEBUG            - turn on debugging

Future plans:

    - develop some neater way of dropping you into the right dir, without 
      spawning mass subshells...
    - leverage octhub to create the initial fork on GH?
    - support for HTTPS GH auth?
