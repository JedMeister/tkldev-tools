## [tkldev-clone conf]

## Add your GH username here
export GH_USER=

## GH protocol to use; options are https|ssh
export TKL_PROT=https
export USR_PROT=ssh

## default behaviour is to name turnkey remote repo 'turnkey' and use $GH_USER
## as 'origin'.

export TKL_REMOTE=turnkey
export USR_REMOTE=origin

## If instead you wish to keep 'turnkey' as 'origin' and name your remote after
## $GH_USER then uncomment these lines (or adjust as you like):
#
#export TKL_REMOTE=origin
#export USR_REMOTE=${GH_USER}

## set what remote master should track. default is turnkey remote master branch, e.g. turnkey/master

export TRACK_REMOTE=${TKL_REMOTE}/master

## to track your own remote and/or alternate branch, uncomment & adjust below
#
#export TRACK_REMOTE=${GH_USER}/other-branch

# Extra remotes to add; in the format "REMOTE_NAME <space/tab> REMOTE_URL"
# Additonal remotes can be added, separated with a newline (for easier reading
# any leading space after the newline is stripped). E.g.:
#
#export XTRA_REMOTES="REMOTE_1 https://github.com/USER_1
#                     REMOTE_2 https://github.com/USER_2"
